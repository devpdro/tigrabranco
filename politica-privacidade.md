You also agree to receive all notices and other communications from us electronically. Winden reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these changes by posting an updated version here: https://winden.co/company/terms. "Company" or "you" means the legal entity that is applying for or that has opened an Account to use the Services and the individual applying for the Account. If you are the individual applying for the Account, you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of Company with the authority to bind Company to this Agreement ("Administrator"), and that you agree to this Agreement on Company’s behalf.

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

1. Use of the Services
Eligibility.
This is a contract between you and Winden. You must read and agree to these terms before using the Services. If you do not agree, you may not use the Services. You may only apply for an Account, and use the applicable Services under such Account, if you are a legal entity formed and registered in the United States and can form a binding contract with Winden. Individual consumers and companies organized and registered outside the United States are not permitted to use or attempt to open or use an Account or the Services. You may only use the Services in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Any use of or access to the Services for consumer or non-commercial purposes or by any individual who is not your employee, contractor, agent, or other individual permitted to use your Account on your behalf ("User") is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement.
‍
‍Applying for an Account.
Your Account gives you access to certain Services, the demand deposit account ("Deposit Account") and debit cards ("Cards") provided by one of our financial institution providers (each a "Banking Provider") and any other functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. You will need to provide Company information and certain personal information (collectively, "Company Information"), when you apply for an Account. Company Information may include your registered business name and state of incorporation, the business address, ownership details, the nature of the business, and other business information we may request from time to time; the name, contact information, and date of birth of Administrators, Users or beneficial owners, and other personal information; and a corporate registration certificate, proof of address, personal identification, and any other documentary information used to verify business and personal information. You acknowledge that you have obtained or will obtain appropriate consent and authorization of any person whose personal information you provide before sharing such data with us.  

We provide Company Information to our Banking Providers and other third-party service providers to determine your eligibility for access to certain Services. We rely on the accuracy of the Company Information you provide us when opening and maintaining your Account. We may deny your application, suspend provision of such Services to you, or close your Account if Company Information is out of date, incomplete, or inaccurate.

‍Account Management and Security.
You must specify at least one Administrator to manage your Account when submitting your Application. Administrators can add, remove, or manage additional Administrators and Users; request and manage Cards for Users;, view transactions and run reports; provide or update Company Information; connect third-party services and other accounts to your Account; and perform other tasks to manage your Account. You are responsible for any actions or failure to act on the part of Administrators or Users, or those using their credentials to access your Account. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account, and you must keep your Account password secure. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (for recommendations on what constitutes a strong password, check the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)) with your Account. You must notify Winden immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account. Winden will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your Account. We may suspend access to your Account if we believe that your Account has been compromised. Your Account is commercial in nature, and you acknowledge and understand that certain consumer protection laws (including the Electronic Funds Transfer Act or Regulation E) and consumer-specific rules (including NACHA rules specific to consumers) do not apply to transactions on your Account or your use of the Services.
‍
‍Fees.
‍We may assess fees for some Services, including periodic fees, usage fees, service fees, and fees applicable to certain transactions. We may also assess fees for late or failed payments, or misuse of your Account or the Services. We will disclose fees to you when opening your Account, when you start using a new Service, or through the Site. We may update, add, or change fees upon 30 days' notice to you. Any accrued or incurred fees will be reflected on your statements.
‍

Governing Law.
You agree that:

This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Los Angeles County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. Subject to Section 10B, you agree that the federal or state courts located in Los Angeles County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the Arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.
‍
‍Arbitration.
READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM WINDEN.
‍
For any claim, dispute, or controversy with Winden (a "Claim"), you agree to first contact us at help@winden.co and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Winden has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, such dispute will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party.
NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website www.jamsadr.com. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Claim immediately after commencement of the arbitration. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of its data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights. Proceedings and information related to them will be maintained as confidential, including the nature and details of the Claim, evidence produced, testimony given, and the outcome of the Claim, unless such information was already in the public domain or was independently obtained. Company and Winden, and all witnesses, advisors, and arbitrators will only share such information as necessary to prepare for or conduct arbitration or other legal proceeding, or enforcement of the outcome, unless additional disclosure is required by law.
‍
‍Class Action Waiver.
You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Claims between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Claim to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Claim to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

By initiating a Card Funding transaction, you authorize us to initiate debits to your card account through card payment networks in order to process the Card Funding transaction, including any applicable fees and charges, and this authorization shall remain in effect so long as you have an Account with Winden unless canceled in accordance with this Agreement.

2. Reversals and Chargebacks
If you initiate a Card Funding transaction that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the funds added to your Account plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee described below). Whenever a Card Funding transaction is reversed, Winden will refund or reverse the transaction from your Winden Account in the same currency as the original transaction. If your Winden Account balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, Winden will perform a currency conversion to refund or reverse the transaction, subject to the exchange rate being offered by Winden in the applicable currencies at that time.

If you dispute a legitimate repayment charge in connection with an Advance Payment (as defined below) and your dispute claim is successful for any reason, you will be responsible for any dispute fees charged to Winden by your financial institution in addition to the repayment of your Advance Payment. 

3. Advance Payments
If you are eligible, the Card Funding program allows you to receive free advances (the “Advance Payments”) on Card Funding transactions which have been initiated, but not yet paid to your Account. Advance Payments may only be used for business purposes, and may not be used for personal, family, or household purposes. There are no costs for access to the Card Funding program and any Advance Payment you choose to receive is free. Typically, Advance Payments will be for the full value of the incoming Card Funding transaction, but this amount may be reduced by Winden in its sole discretion based on factors including, but not limited to, the current balance in your Account, the number of previous Advance Payments you have repaid and the length of your customer relationship.

Once you set up Card Funding, the Advance Payments will be automatically deposited into your Account when we are notified there is a Card Funding transaction in progress, provided that your Account is in good standing and you are eligible to receive an Advance Payment. We will not offer you any additional Advance Payments if you have not fully repaid a prior Advanced Payment. You may turn off Advanced Payments at any time.

4. Your Eligibility for Advance Payments
Advance Payments are available to United States registered businesses in good standing which have a valid US Federal EIN and a state tax identification number.

You must also have an Account with us which is eligible for Card Funding. We determine the amount of any Advance Payments that you are eligible for based on, among other things, your anticipated Card Funding amount, information about your account(s) with us and other financial institutions, as well as your Account and payment history. We may change our eligibility criteria at any time with or without notice to you.

5. Advance Payment Repayment
Each Advance Payment is automatically repaid in one installment by deduction from the associated Card Funding you receive. If the associated Card Funding received is not sufficient to repay the Advance Payment, we reserve the right to deduct the remaining Advance Payment amount from your Account or from subsequent Card Funding payments you receive into your Account. Before you are able to use the Advance Payments, you will be asked to agree that each Advance Payment will be repaid as soon as the associated Card Funding payment is deposited into your Account and to authorize us to process an electronic debit from your Account on that date.

If any payment you have authorized is returned by us or we are otherwise unable to process a payment, we will attempt to debit your Account up to three additional times. We are not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, insufficient fund charges, or any other bank fees that result from your failure to maintain a sufficient balance in your Account. We make no warranties that an overdraft will not occur.

Notwithstanding the above, we warrant that we have no legal or contractual claim or remedy against you based on a failure to repay an Advance Payment. We further warrant that, with respect to any Advance Payment we provide to you,
(i) we will not engage in any debt collection activities if you do not repay the Advance Payment;
(ii) we will not place the amount of the Advance Payment as a debt with, or sell it to, a third party; and
(iii) we will not report the Advance Payment to any consumer reporting agency. However, we will not provide you any further Advance Payment while any repayment remains overdue on any previous Advance Payment.

2.0. Arbitration and Waivers

BE SURE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US.

2.1. Election to Arbitrate

You and Winden agree that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for resolution of a Claim be final and binding arbitration pursuant to this Section 8 (the “Arbitration Provision”). As used in this Arbitration Provision, “Claim” shall include any past, present, or future claim, dispute, or controversy involving you (or persons claiming through or connected with you), on the one hand, and Winden on the other hand, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, and/or the activities or relationships that involve, lead to, or result from this Agreement, including the validity or enforceability of this Arbitration Provision, any part thereof, or the entire Agreement. Claims are subject to arbitration regardless of whether they arise from contract; tort (intentional or otherwise); a constitution, statute, common law, or principles of equity; or otherwise. Claims include matters arising as initial claims, counterclaims, crossclaims, third-party claims, or otherwise. Please note that you may continue to assert Claims in small claims court, if your Claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The scope of this Arbitration Provision is to be given the broadest possible interpretation that is enforceable.

2.2. Applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act; Arbitrator’s Powers

This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”). The arbitrator will apply substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations. The arbitrator may award damages or other types of relief permitted by applicable substantive law, subject to the limitations set forth in this Arbitration Provision. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court. The arbitrator shall take steps to reasonably protect confidential information.

2.3. Informal Dispute Resolution

If a Claim arises, our goal is to address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so, to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. You agree that before filing any claim in arbitration, you will first submit your Claim to us by email at support@winden.co and provide us with the opportunity to resolve your concern prior to initiating arbitration.

2.4. Arbitration Procedures

The party initiating arbitration shall do so with the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) or Judicial Alternatives and Mediation Services (“JAMS”). The arbitration shall be conducted according to the rules and policies of the administrator selected, except to the extent the rules conflict with this Arbitration Provision or any countervailing law. If you have any questions concerning the AAA or would like to obtain a copy of the AAA arbitration rules, you may call 1(800) 778-7879 or visit the AAA's web site at: www.adr.org. If you have any questions concerning JAMS or would like to obtain a copy of the JAMS arbitration rules, you may call 1(800) 352-5267 or visit their web site at: www.jamsadr.com. In the case of a conflict between the rules and policies of the administrator and this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision shall control, subject to countervailing law, unless all parties to the arbitration consent to have the rules and policies of the administrator apply. The arbitration will be held in Los Angeles County, CA or any other location we agree to.

2.5. Arbitration Fees

Filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees) shall be paid in accordance with the rules of the administrator selected, or in accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the administrator's rules. The administrator's hearing fees will be paid by the party requesting the hearing, unless the administrator's rules or applicable law require otherwise. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.

2.6. Appeals

Within 30 days of a final award by the arbitrator, any party may appeal the award for reconsideration by a three-arbitrator panel selected according to the rules of the arbitrator administrator. In the event of such an appeal, any opposing party may cross-appeal within 30 days after notice of the appeal. The panel will reconsider de novo all aspects of the initial award that are appealed. Costs and conduct of any appeal shall be governed by this Arbitration Provision and the administrator's rules, in the same way as the initial arbitration proceeding. Any award by the individual arbitrator that is not subject to appeal, and any panel award on appeal, shall be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

2.7. No Class Actions
‍
NO ARBITRATION SHALL PROCEED ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS (INCLUDING AS PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON BEHALF OF OTHERS), EVEN IF THE CLAIM OR CLAIMS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE ARBITRATION HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSERTED (OR COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED) IN A COURT AS CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS IN A COURT.

Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, no party to the arbitration may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims for or on behalf of two or more individuals or unrelated corporate entities in the same arbitration unless those persons are parties to a single transaction. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, an award in arbitration shall determine the rights and obligations of the named parties only, and only with respect to the claims in arbitration, and shall not (a) determine the rights, obligations, or interests of anyone other than a named party, or resolve any Claim of anyone other than a named party; nor (b) make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone other than a named party. No administrator or arbitrator shall have the power or authority to waive, modify, or fail to enforce this Section 8.7, and any attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, shall be invalid and unenforceable. Any challenge to the validity of this Section 8.7 shall be determined exclusively by a court and not by the administrator or any arbitrator.

2.8. Survival and Severability of Arbitration Provision

This Arbitration Provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision other than Section 8.7 is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision shall nevertheless remain valid and in force. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Arbitration Provision’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief or particular term, then that claim (and only that claim) or that term (and only that term) must be severed from the Arbitration Provision and may be brought in court. If an arbitration is brought on a class, representative, or collective basis, and the limitations on such proceedings in Section 8.7 are finally adjudicated pursuant to the last sentence of Section 8.7 to be unenforceable, then no arbitration shall be had. In no event shall any invalidation be deemed to authorize an arbitrator to determine Claims or make awards beyond those authorized in this Arbitration Provision.

2.9. Judicial Forum for Claims

Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in the event that this Arbitration Provision is found not to apply to you or your Claim, you and Winden agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of California. Both you and Winden consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.

2.10. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO LITIGATE

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVING THAT RIGHT BY AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ARBITRATION PROVISION.
